        I'm planning on going into Graphic Design with a minor in Web Design. I love to play sports, hang out with friends, and create art. 
        I am single at the moment. I feel Like Web Design and Graphic Design go hand in hand in a lot of ways so I figured doing both would 
        Be good for me. I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints all my life. My Favorite quote is from Utchdorf, 
        He said, "We will rarely find something we are not looking for."
