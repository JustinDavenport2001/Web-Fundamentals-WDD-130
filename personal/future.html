          <h2>College</h2>
          <p>
            I hope to take my major in graphic design to new heights by
            networking and building a resume. After college I want to start with
            a company to continue the building of my resume to the point where I
            can finally feel good about freelancing. Freelancing will be my
            second step where I can continue to learn and grow in my field.
            Depending on how both of the first steps go I may jump back into one
            of them, but then I want to start doing photography. Overall there
            are a couple things that I want to try and get good at, then move on
            to the next thing and refine my skills more, just in a little
            different way.

          <h2>Company</h2>
          <p>
            I want to start with joining a business for a couple of years in
            order to grow my skills and credentials as a graphic designer. This
            will also allow me the opportunity to see if I like working with a
            specific company. The plan is to do this for at least 5 years if not
            more.

          <h2>Freelancing</h2>
          <p>
            The next step in my journey is to learn all I can while freelancing.
            I feel like after working with a couple of businesses I'll have a
            better grasp of the concepts and the skills required to do my own
            thing, that being freelancing.

          <h2>Photography</h2>
          <p>
            The last thing that I want to do is to start photography. The main
            reason why this is later is because I want to get plenty of
            experience in the world of business, growing my credentials and
            allowing myself the time to adapt to all that I will need to know
            before learning a new kind of art. I also hope to have done plenty
            of photoshop before this time so that I can tailor what I've done to
            something new. The last thing is that by the time that I want to
            start photography I'll both have the money and time to do so.

      <h2>Other Ideas</h2>
      <p>
        I wish that I could say that I've thought of many other plans, but I
        will be coming up with more plans in the near future. The one thing that
        comes to mind is doing more things tailored to Web Design, the only
        thing is I don't have a good idea of what I would be doing.
