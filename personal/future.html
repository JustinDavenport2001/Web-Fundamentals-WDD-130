      <h1>Future Plans</h1>
      <div class="plans">
        <h2>College</h2>
        <p>
          I hope to take my major in graphic design to new heights by networking
          and building a resume. After college I want to start with a company to
          continue the building of my resume to the point where I can finally
          feel good about freelancing. Freelancing will be my second step where
          I can continue to learn and grow in my field. Depending on how both of
          the first steps go I may jump back into one of them, but then I want
          to start doing photography. Overall there are a couple things that I
          want to try and get good at, then move on to the next thing and refine
          my skills more, just in a little different way.
