        Who Am I?
	My name is Justin Davenport, I’m a graphic designer that has just started my college degree. This means that I am developing and growing in the skills of a master graphic designer. So far I’m only 2 semesters into this degree, therefore some of my designing and developing needs some work.
Why did I make a website?
	First and foremost this is a project for one of my classes and not everything will be finished in one class semester, therefore there may be some pictures that are not mine and the ones that are probably wont be finished or very good in that regard. I want to build off of this website for most of my college experience so that I can continue learning how to code and design a website. This also means that this first project is going to be a rough draft of things to come. 
What are my plans for the future?
	I hope to take my major in graphic design to new heights by networking and building a resume. After college I want to start with a company to continue the building of my resume to the point where I can finally feel good about freelancing. Freelancing will be my second step where I can continue to learn and grow in my field. Depending on how both of the first steps go I may jump back into one of them, but then I want to start doing photography. Overall there are a couple things that I want to try and get good at, then move on to the next thing and refine my skills more, just in a little different way.
